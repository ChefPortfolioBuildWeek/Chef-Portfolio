                  <h2>About</h2>
                  <p>Finding the right chef for your restaurant's concept can be a challenge. The key is to make sure to go through the entire process to vet them properly. Panic hiring is never the answer. The chef position is a critical element to most restaurant brands and the process needs to be respected.</p>

                    <p>The lesson here is how they handle the little things and how they will handle the big things.</p>
                    
                    <p>A lot of chefs interview well. They know the right words to say. Then, they get in the kitchen and you soon discover that they cannot control costs or seem to be able to lead a team. As they say, “all show and no go.”</p>
                    
                    <p>Attention to detail is sadly lacking by a lot of wannabe chefs who just want to do the creative stuff and not the business stuff. You need both elements if you are going to find the right culinary professional for your concept. Like a well-balanced recipe you need all the ingredients to come together to work in harmony. Great chefs are multidimensional and your brand cannot afford to settle for anything less.</p>
